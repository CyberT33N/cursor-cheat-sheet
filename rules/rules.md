      description: This rule prohibits the use of wildcard/star exports in JavaScript and TypeScript files. It requires developers to explicitly list each named export rather than using the catch-all export syntax. This practice improves code clarity, makes dependencies explicit, prevents accidental exports, and enables better static analysis and tree-shaking. The rule applies to all JavaScript and TypeScript files in the project and ensures that the codebase maintains clear and intentional export boundaries.

      # No Star Exports in JavaScript/TypeScript
      
      ## Critical Rules
      
      1.  **NEVER** use star/wildcard exports (`export * from './file'`) in JavaScript or TypeScript files. üö´
      2.  **ALWAYS** explicitly list each named export when re-exporting from another file. ‚úÖ
      3.  When exporting from another module, use named exports with destructuring: `export { name1, name2 } from './file'`.
      4.  For default exports being re-exported, use the explicit syntax: `export { default as ComponentName } from './file'`. (Ensure the source file actually has a default export).
      5.  When creating barrel files (index.ts/js), list all exports individually.
      6.  Clearly identify what specific functionality is being exported from each imported module.
      7.  If many exports need to be re-exported, list them systematically, grouped by source file for better organization.
      8.  When refactoring existing code, replace **ALL** star exports with explicit named exports.
      
      ## Examples
      
      <example>
      // ‚úÖ CORRECT - Explicit named exports
      
      // Explicitly list each export being re-exported
      export { EvidentService } from './EvidentServiceClass.ts'
      export { setAbb, resetSpecificAbbs, checkOrCreateAbbs } from './abbreviation.ts'
      export { executeUserSql } from './sql.ts'
      
      // Re-exporting a default export with a specific name
      export { default as UserComponent } from './UserComponent.ts'
      
      // Grouped by source for better organization when there are many exports
      // From authentication module
      export { login, logout, validateToken } from './auth/authentication.ts'
      export { hasPermission, Role, Permission } from './auth/authorization.ts'
      
      // Using aliased exports when needed
      export { default as Button } from './components/Button.ts'
      export { default as TextField } from './components/TextField.ts'
      export { submitForm as sendFormData } from './forms/submission.ts'
      </example>
      
      <example type="invalid">
      // ‚ùå INCORRECT - Using star exports
      
      // Generic star exports that hide what's actually being exported
      export * from './EvidentServiceClass.ts'
      export * from './abbreviation.ts'
      export * from './sql.ts'
      
      // Star export with default export being re-exported
      export * from './components/Button.ts'
      
      // Star exports in barrel files
      // index.ts
      export * from './models/user.ts'
      export * from './models/post.ts'
      export * from './utils/helpers.ts'
      </example>
      
      ## Why This Rule Is Important
      
      1. **Explicitness and Clarity**: Explicit exports clearly communicate which specific functions, classes, or values are being exported. This makes it easier for developers to understand what a module provides without having to examine the source files.
      
      2. **Better Tree-Shaking**: Bundlers like Webpack and Rollup can more effectively perform tree-shaking (dead code elimination) when exports are explicit. Star exports can prevent proper tree-shaking because the bundler cannot determine which exports are actually used.
      
      3. **Prevents Accidental Exports**: Star exports can inadvertently expose internal implementation details or utilities that were not meant to be part of the public API. Explicit exports ensure only intended functionality is exposed.
      
      4. **Avoids Name Collisions**: When using star exports from multiple modules, name collisions can occur silently, with later exports overriding earlier ones. Explicit exports make such conflicts immediately visible.
      
      5. **Improves Code Navigation**: IDEs and code analysis tools can more easily track explicit imports and exports, improving features like "Go to Definition" and refactoring capabilities.
      
      6. **Better Documentation**: Explicit exports serve as a form of documentation, clearly showing the public API of a module at the export site rather than requiring developers to look through the source files.
      
      ## Implementing This Rule
      
      ### When Creating New Files
      
      When creating new barrel files or modules that re-export from other files:
      
      ```typescript
      // In index.ts, instead of:
      export * from './user-service'
      
      // Do this:
      export { 
        createUser, 
        getUserById, 
        updateUser, 
        deleteUser 
      } from './user-service'
      ```
      
      ### When Refactoring Existing Code
      
      To refactor existing star exports:
      
      1. Identify all exports from the source module:
         ```typescript
         // Check the './user-service.ts' file to see what it exports
         ```
      
      2. Replace the star export with explicit named exports:
         ```typescript
         // Replace:
         export * from './user-service'
         
         // With:
         export { 
           createUser, 
           getUserById, 
           updateUser, 
           deleteUser 
         } from './user-service'
         ```
      
      ### Handling Default Exports
      
      For modules with default exports, ensure you explicitly re-export them using the `default as` syntax. The source module must, of course, have a default export.
      
      ```typescript
      // Source file: ./Button.ts
      // export default class Button { ... }
      
      // Barrel file: ./components/index.ts
      // Instead of (doesn't re-export the default):
      // export * from './Button' 
      
      // Do this:
      export { default as Button } from './Button'
      ```
      
      ## Edge Cases and Exceptions
      
      There are **no exceptions** to this rule. All star exports **MUST** be replaced with explicit named exports, even in the following cases:
      
      1.  **Large Number of Exports**: Even when a module exports many items, they **MUST** all be listed explicitly. This may make the export statement longer but maintains clarity, intentionality, and toolability.
      
      2.  **Re-exporting an Entire API**: When creating a facade or adapter over another library, each re-exported item **MUST** still be listed explicitly.
      
      3.  **Type Exports (TypeScript)**: This rule applies equally to type exports. Since TypeScript **does not allow `export type * from './file';`**, you are already required to use explicit type re-exports: `export type { TypeName1, TypeName2 } from './file'`. This rule reinforces that this explicit practice should be followed for *all* exports, not just types. 
```


Project rules offer a powerful and flexible system with path-specific configurations. Project rules are stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory and provide granular control over AI behavior in different parts of your project.

### How They Work

- **Semantic Descriptions:** Each rule can include a description of when it should be applied.
- **File Pattern Matching:** Use glob patterns to specify which files/folders the rule applies to.
- **Automatic Attachment:** Rules can be automatically included when matching files are referenced.
- **Reference Files:** Use `@file` in your project rules to include them as context when the rule is applied.

You can reference rule files using `@file`, allowing you to chain multiple rules together.

You can create a new rule using the command palette with `Cmd + Shift + P > New Cursor Rule`. By using project rules, you also get the benefit of version control since it's just a file.

### Example Use Cases

- Framework-specific rules for certain file types (e.g., SolidJS preferences for `.tsx` files).
- Special handling for auto-generated files (e.g., `.proto` files).
- Custom UI development patterns.
- Code style and architecture preferences for specific folders.

## Global Rules

<details><summary>Click to expand..</summary>

Global rules can be added by modifying the **Rules for AI** section under **Cursor Settings > General > Rules for AI**.

This is useful if you want to specify rules that should always be included in every project, like output language, length of responses, etc.

For backward compatibility, you can still use a `.cursorrules` file in the root of your project. However, this feature will eventually be removed. We recommend migrating to the new **Project Rules** system for better flexibility and control.
