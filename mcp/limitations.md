# MCP Limitations

ðŸ”´ MCP is **still evolving** â€“ some known limitations:
- Cursor **only sends the first 40 tools** to the Agent.
- MCP **may not work over SSH** or certain remote development setups.
- **Resources (data storage/retrieval)** are **not yet supported** in Cursor (coming in future updates).
