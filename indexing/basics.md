# Index your Codebase

For **better and more accurate** codebase answers, you can **index your codebase**. Cursor computes **embeddings** for each file in your project, using them to **improve search results and AI responses**.

## How It Works

- When a **project is opened**, Cursor **initializes indexing** for that workspace.
- After the initial setup, Cursor will **automatically index new files** added to your workspace.
- The indexing **status** is available under:
  **Cursor Settings > Features > Codebase Indexing**.
