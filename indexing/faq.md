# FAQ for Codebase Indexing

## Where can I see all indexed codebases?

There's **no centralized list** of indexed codebases. To check a project's status:
1. Open the project in Cursor.
2. Navigate to **Codebase Indexing settings**.

## How do I delete all indexed codebases?

- **Option 1:** Delete your Cursor **account** from Settings (removes all indexed data).
- **Option 2:** Manually delete **individual codebases** from Codebase Indexing settings.

**Note:** There's **no bulk delete option** without deleting your account.
