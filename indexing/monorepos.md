# Working with Large Monorepos

For **large monorepos** (hundreds of thousands of files), **strategic indexing** is key.

## Best Practices

- Use `.cursorignore` to let developers configure **which folders and paths** are indexed.
- Add `.cursorignore` to **your global `.gitignore`**.

This helps developers optimize indexing for **their specific work areas**.
