# @ Symbols in Cursor

## Overview

Overview of all `@` symbols available in Cursor for context and commands.

In Cursor's input boxes, such as **Composer, Chat, and Cmd + K**, you can use `@` symbols by typing `@`. A popup menu will appear with a list of suggestions, automatically filtering to show the most relevant options based on your input.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Navigate** through the list of suggestions using the **up/down arrow keys**.
- **Select** a suggestion by pressing **Enter**.
- **IF** the suggestion is a **category** (e.g., `@Files`), the list will refine to show only relevant items within that category.
